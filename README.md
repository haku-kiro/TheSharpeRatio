# TheSharpeRatio
DataQuest Project I did, that shows how to calculate the sharpe ratio

## Description

This project just showcases basic matplot, pandas and numpy usage to analyse financial data. In this jupyter notebook I explore the method to quantify the risk vs return of stock investment by using the sharpe ratio. The datasets are from 2016 and are stored within the project in the form of csv files.

### Side notes:

The datasets, boilerplate notebook, and the idea all come from the site [DataCamp]("https://www.datacamp.com").
